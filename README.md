# Font Bracket

Font Bracket is a site to help you choose fonts for coding, inspired by [codingfont.com](https://www.codingfont.com/), but with a lot more fonts!

## Developing

Run `pnpm install` and start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

Then deploy with `fly deploy`
